## f2bist

CLI utility to handle data as binary strings

The need behind it is to have a quick way to visualize programs as binary string while playing around with [AIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_information_theory)

- Convert data to a binary string of `0` and `1`
- Statistical analysis of `0` and `1` distributions
    - Number of bit string of variable length (`0, 00, 000, 0000, 1, 11, 111, 1111` and so on)
- Visualize binary string as image
- Support online compression and decompression
